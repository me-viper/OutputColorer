            <summary>
            This attribute registers a path that should be probed for candidate assemblies at assembly load time.
            
            For example:
              [...\VisualStudio\10.0\BindingPaths\{5C48C732-5C7F-40f0-87A7-05C4F15BC8C3}]
                "$PackageFolder$"=""
                
            This would register the "PackageFolder" (i.e. the location of the pkgdef file) as a directory to be probed
            for assemblies to load.

            <summary>
            An optional SubPath to set after $PackageFolder$. This should be used
            if the assemblies to be probed reside in a different directory than
            the pkgdef file.

             This is the class that implements the package exposed by this assembly.
            
             The minimum requirement for a class to be considered a valid package for Visual Studio
             is to implement the IVsPackage interface and register itself with the shell.
             This package uses the helper classes defined inside the Managed Package Framework (MPF)
             to do it: it derives from the Package class that provides the implementation of the 
             IVsPackage interface and uses the registration attributes defined in the framework to 
             register itself and its components with the shell.

            Default constructor of the package.
            Inside this method you can place any initialization code that does not require 
            any Visual Studio service because at this point the package object is created but 
            not sited yet inside Visual Studio environment. The place to do all the other 
            initialization is the Initialize method.

        <member name="M:Talk2Bits.OutputColorer.OutputColorerInstallerPackage.Initialize">
            <summary>
            Initialization of the package; this method is called right after the package is sited, so this is the place
            where you can put all the initilaization code that rely on services provided by VisualStudio.
